### Extract Phrases

To extract phrases from the given `corpus.txt` file using SpaCy for text processing, you can follow these steps in Python:

1. **Install SpaCy:**
   If you haven't already installed SpaCy, you can do so using pip:
   ```
   pip install spacy
   ```

2. **Download SpaCy's English language model:**
   ```
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

3. **Python Code to Extract Phrases:**

   ```python
   import spacy
   
   # Load the English language model from SpaCy
   nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
   
   # Read the corpus.txt file
   with open("corpus.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
       corpus_text = file.read()
   
   # Process the corpus text using SpaCy
   doc = nlp(corpus_text)
   
   # Extract noun phrases and verb phrases from the processed text
   phrases = []
   for chunk in doc.noun_chunks:
       phrases.append(chunk.text)
   for chunk in doc:
       if "VP" in chunk.dep_:
           phrases.append(chunk.text)
   
   # Write the extracted phrases to phrases.txt
   with open("phrases.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as output_file:
       for phrase in phrases:
           output_file.write(phrase + "\n")
   ```

This code uses SpaCy to process the text and extract noun phrases (NPs) and verb phrases (VPs) from the corpus. The extracted phrases are then saved in `phrases.txt`. Make sure to place `corpus.txt` in the same directory as this Python script before running it. After execution, you'll find the extracted phrases in the `phrases.txt` file.
